The diastic machine is a method to generate text using a seed file and a word or phrase.
The seed tetxt in this case is `seed.txt` and the phrase is defined by the user.
After reciving both the phrase and the seed the diasrtic machine starts by seraching for a word in the seed file that contains as its first letter the first letter of the user's input.
After the machine seraches for a word in the seed file that contains as its second letter the second letter of the user's input. The machine continues until reaches the last character of the user input.
